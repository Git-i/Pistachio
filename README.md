# Pistachio
Pistachio Game Engine

## Branch Details
This is the branch for adding the [RHI](https://github.com/Git-i/RHI). also the engine is being replaced with a clustered forward renderer. For a branch the builds checkout [dev](https://github.com/Git-i/Pistachio/tree/dev) or [main](https://github.com/Git-i/Pistachio/tree/main).

## Building
Currently the only build system available is with Visual Studio. CMake support was dropped in a random commit, but will be added soon (the engine is to be ported to linux).

## Notice
The history is being re-written to remove some files and slim down the repo, some builds may break but it should be as easy as re-importing a texture
